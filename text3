I suppose that the 'duplicate instance declarations' message is because a data type could be made an instance of both A and B. I want to be able to make a promise to the compiler that I won't do that, or possibly specify a default class to use in the case that a type is an instance of both classes.

Dalvik VM provides facilities for developers to perform custom class loading. Instead of loading Dalvik executable (dex) files from the default location, an application can load them from alternative locations such as internal storage or over the network.

This technique is not for every application; In fact, most do just fine without it. However, there are situations where custom class loading can come in handy. Here are a couple of scenarios:

Big apps can contain more than 64K method references, which is the maximum number of supported in a dex file. To get around this limitation, developers can partition part of the program into multiple secondary dex files, and load them at runtime.
